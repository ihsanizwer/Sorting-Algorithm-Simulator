# Sorting-Algorithm-Simulator
This is an sorting algortithm simulator developed using java. This could be used as a learning tool for newbies to Sorting Algorithms to get an Idea about 2 widely used algorithms. It covers Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. This was developed by me for an Assignment in college, Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology(SLIIT).
